//! 2D cross-correlation over a batch of multi-channel frames.

/// Cross-correlates a (N x C x H x W) sequence with K filters of shape
/// (C x KH x KW), producing a (N x H_OUT x W_OUT x K) sequence: one new channel
/// per filter.
///
/// The kernel is *not* flipped, so this is a correlation, not a convolution,
/// the same choice every deep learning framework makes behind the name `conv2d`.
/// For learned weights the distinction is vacuous, training absorbs the flip.
/// For the hand-written kernels in [`kernels`](super::kernels) it is not:
/// [`Sobel3D::x`](super::Sobel3D::x) measures -d/dx here, where a true
/// convolution would give +d/dx.
///
/// `sequence` is the video: N frames of C channels, each H x W. `filters` is the
/// bank: K filters, each spanning all C input channels over a KH x KW window.
/// Each filter contracts a whole receptive field down to one value, so the input
/// channels disappear and the K filters become the output channels, the result
/// is channel-last, (N x H_OUT x W_OUT x K).
///
/// The window slides by `stride` in both directions. No padding: the output is
/// the usual `(H - KH) / stride + 1` by `(W - KW) / stride + 1`.
///
/// `H_OUT` and `W_OUT` must come from the call site (deriving them from
/// `stride` would need `generic_const_exprs`) and are checked by
/// `im2col_view`. Everything else is inferred from the operands, and the
/// shared C, KH, KW are enforced by the signature.
///
/// The patches are never materialised: `im2col_view` only remaps strides onto
/// the input buffer, and `tensordot_3` contracts that view in place. Cost is
/// N * H_OUT * W_OUT * K * C * KH * KW multiply-adds and zero extra storage.
