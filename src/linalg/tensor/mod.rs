//! Compile-time-shaped, stride-based tensors, one module per rank, each
//! split by concern (construction, access, shape, algebra, ops, indexing).
//!
//! [`tensor2d`] and [`tensor3d`] hold the plain owned tensors and the 2D
//! zero-copy view. [`tensor4d`] adds pluggable storage (stack or heap) and
//! the `im2col_view` that turns a 4D tensor into a 6D receptive-field view
//! without copying. [`tensor6d`] holds the `Rank6` trait (shared by owned
//! `Tensor6D` and the `im2col` `TensorView6D`) and both rank-6 types.
//! [`contraction`] holds the `tensordot_*` family that contracts across
//! them.
